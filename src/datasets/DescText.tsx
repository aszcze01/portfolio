Alien Watch Agency Log - 0000020240319

CONFIDENTIAL

Finally! After over a year of research, we've managed to decode data from the device we found in the wreckage of an alien probe that crashed in December 2022 somewhere in the remote regions of Poland.
The Agency masked the crash site by placing a decoy of a lost training rocket there, although we don't think anyone noticed anything anyway. The only device that survived the crash is likely some kind of mind scanner. It seems that the aliens are mass collecting data either through abductions or remotely scanning minds using probes.

Unfortunately, almost all the data on the device is damaged. We've only been able to partially reconstruct the last record, which contains a scan of the mind of a man from central Poland.

Our Agents extracted as much as they could from incomplete data. Below, we provide a transcription in the form of how Object 2137001 could tell about himself:

While working as a Frontend Developer for the last 9 years, I had the opportunity to implement web projects for companies such as: Kellogg's, Geberit, Coty, Wella Company, mBank, as well as mailing campaigns. Most of it was implemented in React with a .NET backend, as well as PHP. I was also involved in designing some UI elements, graphically processing projects in Photoshop and Figma (and sometimes even in Excel). I have the Contentful Certified Professional Exam certificate.
In my free time, I like to read a book or listen to an audiobook, I also do amateur gardening, I play the guitar, and from time to time I build an electronic device.
